# Secure-Access
A web server built with Node.js and Express for password-protected content access. Using npm for dependencies, it integrates body-parser for parsing form data and path and url modules for file paths. Users enter a password on the home page; correct entries access a protected projects page, while incorrect ones redirect back.
